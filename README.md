The replication code to the EU ETS Master Thesis

EPRTR_Data and 2_ProductionFacility Data are the datasets achieved after using the SQL scripts in the Acer Database file. My EPRTR_Data data file is an excel file. But for ease of uploading to github has been converted to a R.data file. The load code needs to be changed slightly as a result in the Final Version 1. E-PRTR file, which is the file that cleans the dataset after SQL.
